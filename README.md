Supplemental CSS UI
========
Provides a UI for the supplemental CSS selector feature added to core in
version 1.30. Link to documentation is coming. 

We are still debating whether or not this UI should go into core. I'm making
a contrib module available, just in case. 

This module is specifically for Basis theme.
